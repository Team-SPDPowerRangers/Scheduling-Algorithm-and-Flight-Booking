# Scheduling-and-Flight-booking
We are creating an gui based program to book and schedule the flights based on the scheduling and huffman programs

## Description
In this project flights are scheduled based on from place and to place. And for this scheduling "greedy algorithm" is used to get minimum number of flights to cover all the trips. And tickets can be booked for the flights scheduled and boarding can be done for getting tickets.
In the present world scenario, there is a huge need for scheduling to avoid excessive work for any of the applications. In our project we work on the scheduling for the travels using the airspace and here in our problem we work on scheduling the tasks based on the to and the from destination of a passenger and then schedule it on the basis for requirement of minimum number of flights. At first we give the choice for the user to identify themselves as in if they are an employee for the company or they are an customer. If they are an employee then they have an access to schedule the flights with the information from the company. Then when an customer goes to access it they the scheduling flights which are available and then after the selection they go into the page where they give all the required details and these details consist of the personal features after which they submit that form to ensure their details are stored in the database then we go on to give a unique that is entirely based on the Huffman code that is generated and this is used to maintain the secrecy of the person and also to respect his privacy. After this we go the boarding pass section where the person is required to give their code that they got in the section where they initialise their details into the database and now when this code is given we again perform the Huffman decryption to have an analysis if it is the right person or not then if he person is the same one we issue the person to have a safe trip with the boarding pass issued and this boarding pass would be in an pdf format.
